% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/
\usepackage{amssymb}




% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e 
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
% \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.
 \ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
\else
  \usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
\fi


%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
The Integro Difference Equation (IDE) is an increasingly popular model of spatio-temporal processes. Here we develop an estimation framework for the IDE based on spatial auto-correlation and cross-correlation of the observed field to estimate the spatial mixing kernel, field disturbance and observation noise variance. Synthetic examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the estimation algorithm.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,

% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{C}{omplex} spatio-temporal behaviour is found in many different systems such as aquatic ecosystems \cite{Schofield2002}, meteorological forecasting \cite{Xu2005}, air pollution \cite{Romanowicz2006}, soil temperature  \cite{Bond-Lamberty2005}, chemical processes \cite{Deng2005}, disease spread \cite{Kuo2009} and real estate market \cite{Sun2005}. Spatio-temporal modelling aims to represent dynamic system behaviour across time and space. %WEINAND1972

Techniques for modelling spatio-temporal systems are generating growing interest, both in the applied and theoretical literature. Of particular interest are the class of dynamic spatio-temporal models, including Cellular Automata (CA) \cite{Wolfram1994}, Coupled Map Lattices (CMLs) \cite{Billings2002}, Lattice Dynamical Wavelet Neural Network (LDWNN) \cite{Wei2009} and spatially correlated time series  \cite{Pfeifer1980,Glasbey2008,Dewar2007} which have all been used in a system identification context. The extent of the spatial interactions in these models is determined by a discrete neighbourhood structure.


Another such model is the Integro-Difference Equation (IDE). These models have received much attention in population ecology as models for the spatio-temporal spread of organisms \cite{Kot1992,Kot1996} and in the brain dynamics to model the electrophysiological data  \cite{Deco2008,Schiff2008,Freestone2011}. IDE models combine discrete temporal dynamics with a continuous spatial representation. The dynamics of this model are given by a spatial mixing kernel, which defines the mapping between the current spatial field and the previous spatial field. The IDE model can be applied to data sampled both regularly and irregularly in space due to the continuous representation of each spatial field. Estimating the underlying spatial field in time is of particular interest which can be achieved by estimating the associated spatial mixing kernel from measured data, and then using this in a filtering framework \cite{Dewar2009}. 


Wikle et al. \cite{Wikle2002} describe the IDE using a state-space formulation by decomposing the kernel and the field using a set of spectral basis functions. An alternative approach for the decomposition of the IDE was introduced in \cite{Dewar2009} where the resulting state and parameter space dimensions are independent of the number of observation locations. This is crucial not only for model parsimony but also has implications for studying systems observed at a high spatial resolution. In this method an Expectation-Maximisation (EM)  algorithm \cite{Dempster1977,Gibsona2005}  was used to estimate both the field and the kernel from the observed data. A similar approach is adopted by \cite{Scerri2009} which developed a model selection procedure by considering various spatial scales at which to represent the system.  

In this paper we take a different approach, using the average (over time) spatial auto-correlation and cross-correlation  of the observed field a simple method is proposed to estimate the spatial mixing kernel, filed disturbance characteristics and the observation noise variance. This eliminate the computational complexity imposed by the methods in \cite{Dewar2009,Scerri2009} while they assumed that disturbance and noise characteristics were known to the estimator. Although the proposed method only estimate the spatial mixing kerne, disturbance and observation noise statistics, the results can be used as a prerequisite for the EM algorithm, providing better and efficient state and parameter estimations.

The rest of this paper is set out as follows: in Section 2, the stochastic IDE model is briefly reviewed. Section 3 introduces the estimation framework and provides necessary formulation  to construct such an estimator using observed field. In Section 5, synthetic examples are given to demonstrate the ability of the developed algorithm  in estimation of the spatial mixing kernel, field disturbannce and observation noise. Finally conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class

\section{Stochastic IDE model}
The spatially homogeneous, linear IDE is given by
\begin{equation}
 z_{t+1}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\int_{\Omega}k\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right)z_{t}\left(\mathbf{r}'\right)d\mathbf{r}'+e_{t}\left(\mathbf{r}\right)
\label{eq:ConvolutionIntegral}
\end{equation}
where $t\in \mathbb{Z}_0 $ denotes discrete time, $\mathbf{r} \in \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ are spatial locations in $n$-dimensional physical space, where $n \in \left\lbrace 1,2,3 \right\rbrace $. The continuous spatial field at time $t$ and at location $\mathbf r$ is denoted $z_t\left(\mathbf r\right)$. The model dynamics  are defined by the homogeneous time invariant spatial mixing kernel, $k\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right):\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which maps the current spatial field to the next spatial field via the integral (\ref{eq:ConvolutionIntegral}). The disturbance $e_{t}(\mathbf{r})$ is a zero-mean normally distributed noise process, spatially colored but temporally independent, with covariance \cite{Rasmussen2005}
\begin{equation}
cov\left(e_{t}\left(\mathbf{r}\right),e_{t+t'}\left(\mathbf{r'}\right)\right)=\sigma_d\gamma(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'})\delta(t-t'),
\label{eq:FieldDisturbance}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'})$ is a spatially homogeneous covariance function, $\sigma_d$ is disturbance variance and $\delta(\cdot)$ is the Dirac-delta function. The mapping between the spatial field and the observations, denoted by $\mathbf{y}_t$, is modeled using the observation function that incorporates sensors with a spatial extent
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ObservationEquation}
	y_t(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{\Omega} { m\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right) z_t\left(\mathbf{r}'\right) \, d\mathbf{r}'} + \varepsilon_t(\mathbf{r}_n), 
\end{equation}
where $m\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right)$ is the observation kernel defined by the Gaussian
\begin{equation}
	m\left(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'\right) = \exp{\left(-\frac{(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')^\top(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')}{\sigma_m^2}\right)},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_m$ sets the kernel width. The superscript $\top$ denotes the transpose operator and $\varepsilon_t(\mathbf{r}_n) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0,\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\varepsilon}\right)$ denotes a multivariate normal distribution with mean zero and the covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\varepsilon} = \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2\mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.
\section{Estimation method} 
For the derivation of the spatial properties estimator of the field equations we will switch to a more compact notation to define convolution and correlation operators. The spatial convolution shall be denoted as
\begin{equation}
	\int_\Omega a(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')b(\mathbf{r}')d\mathbf{r}' = (a\ast b)(\mathbf{r}),
\end{equation}
and the spatial cross-correlation shall be denoted as 
\begin{equation}
	\int_\Omega a(\mathbf{r})b(\mathbf{r}+\boldsymbol{\tau})d\mathbf{r} = (a\star b)(\boldsymbol{\tau}).
\end{equation}
\subsection{Estimation of Connectivity Kernel Support}
The spatial relationship between consecutive observations is governed by the shape of the connectivity kernel. Therefore, the spatial cross-correlation between consecutive observations is used to estimate the kernel's support and shape. To begin the derivation we define the spatial cross-correlation between consecutive observations (in time) as
\begin{equation}
	R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) = \left(y_{t+1}\star y_t\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\tau}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the spatial shift. The goal of the derivation is to make the necessary substitutions and simplifications to get an expression of the cross-correlation as a function of the connectivity kernel. In the next step we substitute equation~\ref{eq:ObservationEquation} for $y_{t+1}(\mathbf{r})$ and expand to give
\begin{equation}
	R_{y_{t+1}y_t}\left(\boldsymbol{\tau}\right) = \left(\left(m \ast z_{t+1}\right)\star y_t\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\tau}\right) + \left(\varepsilon_{t+1} \star y_t\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\tau}\right).
\end{equation}
Next we substitute equation~\ref{eq:ConvolutionIntegral} for $z_{t+1}(\mathbf{r})$ giving 
\begin{align}
	R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) &= (\left(m \ast \left(k\ast z_t + e_t\right)\right) \star y_t)(\boldsymbol{\tau})\nonumber\\
	&= \left(\left(m\ast k\ast z_t\right)\star y_t \right)(\boldsymbol{\tau}) + \left(\left(m\ast e_t\right)\star y_t \right)(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \nonumber \\
	&+ \left(\varepsilon_{t+1} \star y_t\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\tau}\right).
\end{align}
Now we take the expectation over time, so that the observation noise and process disturbance terms have minimal effect on the result, giving 
\begin{align}\label{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise}
	\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] &= \mathbf{E} \left(\left(m\ast k\ast z_t\right)\star y_t \right)(\boldsymbol{\tau}) ],
\end{align}
since the disturbance and measurement noise are assumed to be independent of the observations and temporally white. Now by substituting $y_t - \varepsilon_t$ in for $m\ast z_t$ the above equation can be written as
 \begin{align}\label{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise}
	\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] &= \mathbf{E} [\left( k\ast (y_t - \varepsilon_t)\star y_t \right)(\boldsymbol{\tau}) ].
\end{align}
To isolate the kernel, the order of the convolution and cross-correlation is reversed by recognizing that a property $(a \ast b)(\boldsymbol\iota) \star c(\boldsymbol\iota) = a(-\boldsymbol\iota)\ast(b \star c)(\boldsymbol\iota)$ (see Appendix~\ref{ap:CorrelationAnalysis}). Therefore,
\begin{align}\label{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise1}
 (k \ast (y_t - \varepsilon_t)) \star y_t)(\boldsymbol\tau) &= k(-\boldsymbol\tau) \ast ((y_t - \varepsilon_t)) \star y_t)(\boldsymbol\tau).
\end{align}  
Substituting equation \ref{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise1} back into equation \ref{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise} we have
\begin{align}\label{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise2}
	\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] &= k(-\boldsymbol\tau) \ast \mathbf{E} [((y_t - \varepsilon_t)) \star y_t)(\boldsymbol\tau)].
\end{align} 
The cross-correlation is further simplified by recognizing that the right hand side of equation~\ref{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise2} can be written as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:FirstTermReduced}  
	\mathbf{E}&\left[\left(\left(y_t-\varepsilon_t\right) \star y_t \right)(\boldsymbol{\tau})\right] = \mathbf{E}\left[ (y_t \star y_t)(\boldsymbol{\tau}) - \left(\varepsilon_t\star y_t \right)(\boldsymbol{\tau})\right] \nonumber \\
	&=\mathbf{E}[ R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})  - \left(\varepsilon_t \star (m\ast v_t + \varepsilon_t)\right) (\boldsymbol{\tau})] \nonumber\\
	&=\mathbf{E}[ R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) -\left(\varepsilon_t\star (m\ast v_t)\right)(\boldsymbol{\tau}) - (\varepsilon_t\star\varepsilon_t)(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\nonumber \\
	&=\mathbf{E}[ R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol{\tau}), 
\end{align}
where $\delta\left(\cdot\right)$ denotes Kronecker delta. Now substituting equation \ref{eq:FirstTermReduced} into \ref{eq:ExpectationToCancelNoise2} gives
 \begin{align}\label{eq:Tobesolvedforthekernel}
	\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] &= k(-\boldsymbol\tau) \ast \left(\mathbf{E}[ R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol{\tau})\right).
\end{align} 
The solution of the above equation for the connectivity kernel is a deconvolution. Using the convolution theorem \eqref{eq:Tobesolvedforthekernel} can be solved for the kernel in the frequency domain.
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-XcorrFourier}
	\mathcal{F}\{k(-\boldsymbol\tau)\} \mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol\tau))\} &= \mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}.
\end{align}
Now rearranging \eqref{eq:EM-XcorrFourier} gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EM-Fourier_TF_of_Kernel}
	\mathcal{F}\left(k(-\boldsymbol\tau)\right) = \left[\frac{\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}}{\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol\tau))\}}\right].
\end{equation}
From \eqref{eq:EM-Fourier_TF_of_Kernel} it can be seen that to compute the exact shape of the kernel, the observation noise variance is required. An error in the initial guess of  the observation noise variance will result in a distortion in the shape of the kernel, however if the signal-to-noise ratio is high such a distortion becomes insignificant.
By the Wiener-Khintchine theorem (WKT) the denominator in \eqref{eq:EM-Fourier_TF_of_Kernel} is equivalent to the power spectral density (PSD) of the noise-free observations which is non-negative and a real quantity. The WKT states that the power spectral density of the wide sense stationary process is the Fourier transform of its auto-correlation function \cite{Ricker2003}. The numerator is also known as the cross-spectrum or cross-spectral density. The WKT allows to establish the bounds on the initial guess of $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right]& - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol\tau))\}\ge0 \nonumber \\
	\implies & \mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right]\}\ge\mathcal{F}\{\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol\tau))\}\ge0 \nonumber \\
	\implies & \min\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right]\}\ge\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2\ge0. \label{eq:BoundOnObsVariance}
\end{align}
Since the connectivity kernel is a real function, the following relation holds \cite{Bracewell2000}
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{F}\left(k(\boldsymbol\tau)\right)=\overline{\mathcal{F}\left(k(-\boldsymbol\tau)\right)},
\end{equation}
where over-bar denotes the complex conjugate operator. Finally, an expression for the kernel is obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform giving
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EM-KernelSolution}
	k(\boldsymbol\tau) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\overline{\left\{\frac{\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}}{\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right]\} - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 }\right\}}.
\end{equation}
The complex conjugate operator essentially reflects the connectivity kernel through the origin in the spatial domain, therefore, if the connectivity kernel is isotropic, the complex conjugate operator can be dropped. 
% Alternatively, the convolution can be written as a system of linear equations by forming the convolution (Toeplitz) matrix. The solution of the convolution equation for $w(\cdot)$ can then be found by either inverting the convolution matrix or directly solving the system of equations.  
% Directly solving the system is the most numerically stable and less computationally demanding then inverting the convolution matrix. To show this we take the spatial Fourier transform of both sides of equation~\ref{} giving
\subsubsection{Estimation of disturbance covariance support}

Similar to the above, the aim of the derivation is to make the necessary substitutions and simplifications to get an expression of the auto-correlation as a function of the disturbance covariance function. The observation auto-correlation at time $t+1$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EM-ObservationEquationAutocorrelation}
	R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\iota})=(y_{t+1} \star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol\iota).
\end{equation}
 After substituting for $y_{t+1}$ from \eqref{eq:ObservationEquation} and using \eqref{eq:ConvolutionIntegral}   for $z_{t+1}$, equation \eqref{eq:EM-ObservationEquationAutocorrelation} is expanded to give
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-expanded_auto_corr}
	R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\tau}) &= ((m\ast k\ast z_t)\star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol{\tau}) \nonumber \\
	&+((m\ast e_{t})\star  y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol{\tau})+(\varepsilon_{t+1} \star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol{\tau}).
\end{align}
By using similar arguments that were used in the derivation for the connectivity kernel support, the auto-correlation can be simplified by recognising that
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-Autoterm2}
	((m\ast k \ast z_t) \star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol\tau) &= k(-\boldsymbol\tau) \ast R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau),
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-Autoterm3}
 (\varepsilon_{t+1}\star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol\iota)&=\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2\delta(\boldsymbol{\iota}).
\end{align}
Substituting \eqref{eq:EM-Autoterm2}, and ~\eqref{eq:EM-Autoterm3} back into \eqref{eq:EM-expanded_auto_corr} and taking the expectation over time  gives
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-Auto&CrossNoisy}
	\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\iota})] &= k(-\boldsymbol\tau) \ast (\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] ) \nonumber \\
	&+\mathbf{E}[((m\ast e_t)\star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol\tau)] +\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\delta(\boldsymbol{\tau}).
\end{align}
The second term in \eqref{eq:EM-Auto&CrossNoisy} can be simplified as
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-term3Noisy}
\mathbf{E}&[((m\ast e_t)\star y_{t+1})(\boldsymbol\tau)]\nonumber \\
&=\mathbf{E}[((m\ast e_t)\star (m\ast z_{t+1}+\varepsilon_{t+1})) (\boldsymbol\tau)] \nonumber \\
	&= \mathbf{E}[(\left(m \ast e_t\right) \star (m \ast [k\ast z_t + e_t]+\varepsilon_{t+1}))(\boldsymbol\tau)] \nonumber \\
	&=\mathbf{E}[\left(m \ast e_t\right)\star\left(m \ast e_t\right)(\boldsymbol\tau)].
\end{align}  
This holds as the disturbance, $e_t$, is not correlated with the field, $z_t$, and the observation noise, $\varepsilon_{t+1}$. A property of cross-correlation and convolution is $(a \ast b)(\boldsymbol\tau) \star (a \ast b)(\boldsymbol\tau)=(a \star a)(\boldsymbol\tau)\ast(b \star b)(\boldsymbol\tau)$ (see Appendix~\ref{ap:CorrelationAnalysis}). By using this relationship and the isotropy property of the observation kernel \eqref{eq:EM-term3Noisy} can be written
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-Autoterm4}
\mathbf{E}[(\left(m \ast e_t\right)\star\left(m \ast e_t\right))(\boldsymbol\tau)]&=\mathbf{E}[(\left(m \star m\right)\ast\left(e_t \star e_t\right))(\boldsymbol\tau)] \nonumber \\
&=(m\ast m \ast \gamma)(\boldsymbol\tau).
\end{align}
Substituting this back into \eqref{eq:EM-Auto&CrossNoisy} gives
\begin{align}
	\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})] &=k(-\boldsymbol\tau) \ast (\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] ) \nonumber \\
	&+(m\ast m \ast \gamma)(\boldsymbol\tau) +\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\delta(\boldsymbol{\tau}).
\end{align}
To solve for the disturbance covariance function, once again the convolution theorem is used. Taking the Fourier transform and rearranging gives
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{F}\{(m\ast m \ast \gamma)(\boldsymbol\tau)\} &= \mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}\nonumber \\ 
	&-\mathcal{F}\{k(-\boldsymbol\tau)\}\mathcal{F}\left\{\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] \right\}-\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2.
\end{align}
Now substituting in \eqref{eq:EM-Fourier_TF_of_Kernel} for $\mathcal{F}\{w(-\boldsymbol{\tau})\}$ results in
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{F}&\{(m\ast m \ast \gamma)(\boldsymbol\tau)\} = \mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}\nonumber \\ 
	&-\left[\frac{\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}}{\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 \delta(\boldsymbol\tau))\}}\right]\mathcal{F}\left\{\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] \right\} -\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2.\label{eq:EM-mmgamma}
\end{align}
Now simplifying the above equation gives
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-MMGFourier1}
	\mathcal{F}&\{m(\boldsymbol\tau)\}\mathcal{F}\{m(\boldsymbol\tau)\}\mathcal{F}\{\gamma(\boldsymbol\tau)\} =\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\} \nonumber \\ &-\left[\frac{\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}\mathcal{F}\left\{\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] \right\}}{\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right]\} - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}\right]-\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 ,
\end{align}
rearranging and taking the inverse Fourier transform yields the final result
\begin{align}\label{eq:EM-MMGFourier2}
	&\gamma(\boldsymbol\tau) = \nonumber \\
&\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\lbrace \frac{1}{\tilde{m}(\boldsymbol\tau)}\Bigg[\left[\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}-\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2\right] \nonumber \right.\\
 &\left. \left.- \left[\frac{\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{E}[R_{y_{t+1}y_t}(\boldsymbol{\tau})]\}\mathcal{F}\left\{\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_{t+1}}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right] \right\}}{\mathcal{F}\{(\mathbf{E}\left[R_{y_ty_t}(\boldsymbol\tau)\right]\} - \sigma_{\varepsilon}^2}\right]\right]\right\rbrace,
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
 \tilde{m}(\boldsymbol\tau)=\mathcal{F}\{m(\boldsymbol\tau)\}\mathcal{F}\{m(\boldsymbol\tau)\}.
\end{equation}
% from \eqref{eq:EM=mmgamma},  when considering a sensor with a spatial extent equation \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier2} should be used
From \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier2}, to calculate the exact shape of the disturbance covariance function, the observation noise variance and the sensor kernel support are required. Again if the signal-to-noise ratio is high the effect of $\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$ would be small. Note the first bracket and the denominator in \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier2} are non-negative power spectral densities of the noise-free observations at time $t+1$ and $t$ respectively. If $m(\cdot)$ is a point sensor then the spatial support of $\gamma(\cdot)$ can be calculated directly, when considering a sensor with a spatial extent, dividing by $\tilde{m}(\boldsymbol\iota)$ in \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier2} is then required.  Alternatively, assuming a Gaussian shape for both the disturbance function and the sensor kernel (with known support), the support of the disturbance covariance function, $\sigma^2_{\gamma}$, can be determined analytically using the expression for Gaussian basis functions' convolution, giving 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EM-AnalyticSupportCalculation}
 \sigma_{\gamma}^2=\sigma_{mm\gamma}^2-2\sigma_m^2,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{mm\gamma}^2$ is the width of the fitted Gaussian function to the estimated support of $(m\ast m\ast\gamma)(\boldsymbol\tau)$ from \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier1}.

Note using uniform observation samples in equations \eqref{eq:EM-KernelSolution}, \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier1} and \eqref{eq:EM-MMGFourier2} provide an approximate solution to the estimated supports of the connectivity kernel and disturbance covariance function.
\section{Simulation}
This section demonstrates the identification of the proposed IDE model. Primarily, the MRA of a synthetic model is demonstrated, which is able to represent the system at different spatial scales. In addition, the complexity of the field decomposition is shown to be independent to the number and spatial regularity of the observation locations. This allows the construction of parsimonious models using spatially dense observations, and demonstrates the utility of the approach to situations where the observations are not arranged on a regular lattice, i.e. sensor networks \cite{Sahu2008}.
\subsection{One dimensional example}
 Consider the following homogeneous multiscale spatial mixing kernel 
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{0.0em}
\begin{eqnarray}
k\left(s-r\right)&=& -\phi_{4;0,-3}\left(s-r\right)+\phi_{4;0,-2}\left(s-r\right)\nonumber\\
&&{-}\:0.5\psi_{4;1,-6}\left(s-r\right)+0.5\psi_{4;1,-3}\left(s-r\right)
\label{eq:1DSimulationKernel}
\end{eqnarray}
\setlength{\arraycolsep}{5pt}
The kernel and its decomposition are plotted in  \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernel}}. The dynamics associated with the IDE defined by (\ref{eq:1DSimulationKernel}) will be oscillatory and dissipative to initial conditions. The field is decomposed using scaling functions $\phi_{4;0,k} $ and the associated wavelet functions $\psi_{4;j,k} $ with $j=0,1$. Observations are then generated from (\ref{eq:ConstructionIntegral1}-\ref{eq:Pi}) for spatial domain defined as $\mathcal{S}=\left[0,10 \right] $ in response to an initial condition where $\boldsymbol\Sigma_v=0.2 \times \mathbf{I}_{n_y}$ and $ \eta(s-r)=2.5\times\phi_{4,3,-2}(s-r)$. The response was sampled at 50 irregularly spaced random locations, at $t=1, \cdots 400 $.

% \end{figure*}   
In order to estimate the spatial mixing kernel and the spatio-temporal field, the  kernel and the field are decomposed using
\begin{equation}
 k\left(s-r\right)=\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}\alpha_{0,l}\phi_{4;0,l}\left(s-r\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{1} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}\beta_{j,l}\psi_{4;j,l}\left(s-r\right)
\label{1DKernelDecompositionForSimulation}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 z_t\left(s\right)=\sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}}x_{t,0,l}\phi_{4;0,l}\left(s\right)+\sum_{j=0}^{1} \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} \check{x}_{t,j,l}\psi_{4;j,l}\left(s\right)
\label{1DFieldDecompositionForSimulation}
\end{equation}
Note that the number of translation operations depends on the spatial range of the data. It follows that the total number of terms in (\ref{1DKernelDecompositionForSimulation}) and (\ref{1DFieldDecompositionForSimulation}) are 8 and 47 respectively. The estimated kernel in \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernelEstimate} } is obtained for the cubic B-spline, with initial scale 0 and maximum scale 1. The EM algorithm is allowed to run for 30 iterations to avoid any issues regarding early stopping, though typically the change in $\parallel \mathbf{A} \parallel_{F}$ falls below $10^{-4} $ after less than 15 iterations. A total number of 500 estimation experiments are performed, where $v_t$ and $w_t$ are re-generated each trial.


 The performance measure employed here is the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) defined as
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{E}\left[\int_{\mathcal{S}}\left[e\left(s\right) \right]^2ds  \right]
\label{MISE} 
\end{equation}
 where  $e\left(s\right)$ is the error between the unknown function, $f\left( s\right) $ and its estimate, $\hat{f}\left( s\right) $. In this example the original kernel and the field are known and hence the integral in  (\ref{MISE}) can be computed analytically. For spatial mixing kernel we have
\begin{eqnarray}
 \lefteqn{\int_{\mathcal{S}}\left[e\left(s\right)\right]^2ds}\nonumber \\  &=\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)^\top\left[ \int_{\mathcal{S}}\boldsymbol\lambda\left(s-r\right)\boldsymbol\lambda\left(s-r\right)^\top ds\right] \left(\boldsymbol{\theta}-\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\right)&
\label{MISEKernel}
\end{eqnarray}
  Here, we are particularly interested in assessing the performance improvement as the scale of the details in MRA is increased. Performance based on (\ref{MISEKernel}) at different spatial scales and over 500 trials have been evaluated. The MISE of the model at $j=0$ is 0.024 and reduces to 0.005 when $\psi_{4;1,k}$ terms are also included in the model, in fact estimation performance is improved by a factor of 4.8. The coarsest approximation of the kernel along with its approximation at $j=1$ are illustrated in \figurename{\ref{fig:SpatialMixingKernelEstimate}. It can be seen that the model is able to estimate both slowly and rapidly varying segments of the  kernel with very high accuracy.  Field estimates  at a selection of time instants are shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:1DFieldEstimation}}. It is clearly observed that the coarse and fine features of the original field have been captured accurately over regions where observations are available. Observation locations are generated randomly, as shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:FieldVariance}. Assuming the observed field can be fully described by the  decomposed IDE model, the variance of the field can be computed to express the  uncertainty of the estimation, at each point in space and at time $t$ we have 
\begin{equation}
 \text{Var}(\hat z_t(s_i))=\boldsymbol\mu^{\top}(s_i) \mathbf P_{t|T}\boldsymbol\mu(s_i)
\label{eq:FieldVariance}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf P_{t|T} $ is the covariance matrix associated with the  state estimates obtained from the RTS smoother. Variance based on (\ref{eq:FieldVariance}) at each spatial location and at $t=50$ is shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:FieldVariance}}. The uncertainty of the estimation is higher at almost  every spatial location at $j=1$ compared to $j=0$. This is to be expected as there are more wavelet basis functions at higher resolution and hence more associated weights need to be estimated. Peaks in the variance of the field coincide with regions where no observations have been made. Increasing the number of observation locations, or using equally spaced observation locations would reduce the variance of the field estimation.

\subsection{Two dimensional example}
In order to demonstrate the ability of the developed model in higher dimensions, a two dimensional IDE model with a single B-spline kernel $\phi_{4;0,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_1-r_1,s_2-r_2\right) $ and $\mathbf l=[-2,-2]^ \top$ is used with parameter $\theta=1$. In this example spatial region $\mathcal{S}=[0,4]^2 $ is simulated over $t=\left\lbrace1 \cdots 200  \right\rbrace $ using $7$ scaling and wavelet functions at $j=0$ together with $24$ wavelet functions at $j=1$. Univariate cubic B-spline scaling and wavelet functions are used to generate 2-D basis functions using (\ref{eq:2Dscalingfunction}-\ref{eq:2Dwavelet_3}). A set of $250$ random  observation locations is used; $\mathbf{\Sigma}_v$ is taken the same as that in example 1 and $ \eta\left(s_1-r_1,s_2-r_2\right) =2.5\times\phi_{4,3,\mathbf{l}}\left(s_1-r_1,s_2-r_2\right)$ where $\mathbf l=[-2,-2]^ \top$. The histogram of the parameter estimates  in \figurename{\ref{fig:2DHist} is generated using 500 runs of the EM algorithm. For comparison, snapshots for the original and the corresponding coarse and fine field estimates at time instants 5, 50 and 150 are illustrated in \figurename{\ref{fig:2DFieldEstimation1}-\ref{fig:2DFieldEstimation3}}. In addition, the MISE of the dynamic field at some time instants are presented in Table \ref{table:ValidationResultField}.  This shows that the multiresolution IDE model can estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the original system accurately. The accuracy of the estimation remains consistent over time. Performance is improved significantly at $j=1$ compared to the case where $j=0$.

\section{Conclusion}
A multi-resolution approach to modelling spatio-temporal systems has been presented. This model is able to represent continuous-space, discrete-time dynamics at a number of spatial scales simultaneously. This ability greatly extends the class of system which the Integro-Difference Equation can represent.


By decomposing both the spatial field and the spatial mixing kernel using a wavelet decomposition, it becomes possible to represent small scale details in the field at the same time as large scale details. This is an essential component of any practical spatio-temporal model, without which the model must be artificially separated into global and local modes a-priori.


The complexity of the model is not affected by the spatial resolution of the observation process, rather it reflects the underlying complexity of the system under study. Therefore, increasing the resolution at which the system is observed does not necessarily increase the complexity of the system identification problem. However the developed algorithm is sensitive to the state dimension, equivalent to the detail represented in the field, and hence intelligent approaches to reduce the number of basis functions is noted as future work. 

By considering different levels of decomposition, the proposed approach could be used as a method of determining the appropriate scales of decomposition, within a model-selection framework. Combined with an approach to sparsely modelling spatial heterogeneity, such as boundary conditions, this would allow the application of this work to a real-world data set.

\section*{Convolution and Correlation}
To show 
\begin{equation}
 \left(a \ast b \right)\left(\tau\right)  \star c\left(\tau\right)  = a\left(-\tau\right)\ast\left(b \star c\right)\left(\tau\right),
\end{equation}
we note that cross-correlation function is related to the convolution by \cite{Yarlagadda2009}
\begin{equation}
 \left(a \star b\right)\left(\tau\right)= a\left(-\tau \right)\ast b\left(\tau\right).
\end{equation}
Therefore, we can write
\begin{align}
 \left(a \ast b\right)\left(\tau\right) \star c\left(\tau\right)&= \left(a \ast b\right)\left(-\tau \right)\ast c\left(\tau\right) \nonumber \\
&=a\left(-\tau\right)\ast \left(b\left(-\tau\right) \ast c\left(\tau\right)\right)\nonumber \\
&=a\left(-\tau\right)\ast\left(b\star c\right)\left(\tau\right)
\end{align}
