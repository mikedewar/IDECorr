	solar radiation was recorded at 10 sites every 10 min in the Pentland
	Hills to the south of Edin-
	
	burgh. We identify spatiotemporal auto-regressive moving average models
	as the most appro-
	
	priate to address this problem. Although previously considered computationally
	prohibitive to
	
	work with, we show that by approximating using toroidal space and
	fitting by matching auto-
	
	correlations, calculations can be substantially reduced. We find that
	a first-order spatiotemporal
	
	auto-regressive (STAR(1)) process with a first-order neighbourhood
	structure and a Matern
	
	noise process provide an adequate fit to the data, and we demonstrate
	its use in simulating
	
	realizations of energy output.},

	processes.
	
	In situations with complicated dynamics such as wave propagation,
	it is
	
	difficult to parameterize state transition functions for high-dimensional
	state processes.
	
	Although in some cases prior understanding of the physical process
	can be
	
	used to formulate models for the state transition, this is not always
	possible. Alternatively,
	
	for processes where one considers discrete time and continuous space,
	
	complicated dynamics can be modeled by stochastic integro-difference
	equations
	
	in which the associated redistribution kernel is allowed to vary with
	space and/or
	
	time. By considering a spectral implementation of such models, one
	can formulate
	
	a spatio-temporal model with relatively few parameters that can accommodate
	
	complicated dynamics. This approach can be developed in a hierarchical
	framework
	
	for non-Gaussian processes, as demonstrated on cloud intensity data.},
